To start a Uvicorn server, you can use the following command in your terminal:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Here:
main is the name of your main application file (e.g., main.py)
app is the name of the FastAPI application instance (e.g., app = FastAPI())
--host 0.0.0.0 specifies the host address to bind to (in this case, all available network interfaces)
--port 8000 specifies the port number to use (in this case, port 8000)
You can also add additional options, such as:
--reload to enable automatic reloading of the application when changes are detected
--workers to specify the number of worker processes to use
--log-level to set the logging level (e.g., info, debug, etc.)
Example with additional options:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload --workers 4 --log-level debug
Make sure to replace main and app with the appropriate names for your application.
Once you run the command, Uvicorn will start the server and make your application available at the specified host and port.
